## Introduction
Accurate liability representation is a critical consideration while transferring the codebase. 

As the Variable Debt Token is a representation of the borrowers' liabilities, its transferability may result in unapproved debt rises.

By performing a mainnet fork of the aave v3 core, i was able to perform upgrade to the variabledebttoken smart contract and implemented a transfer functionality while keeping consistency with the incentivizedERC20 contract.

```
/**
* @dev Implements ERC20 transfer functionality
*/
 function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external virtual override returns (bool) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    return true;
  }
```

Because of this, the transfer feature implementation needs to guarantee that operations affecting borrowers' liabilities can only be carried out by authorized institutions, such the Aave protocol. By doing this, the protocol's integrity is guaranteed, and illegal manipulation of debt situations is avoided.

Even though the increaseAllowance, and decreaseAllowance functions revert, the transfer of the debt token will still be complete because i've implemented the transfer function correctly to handle transfers.

ERC20 transfer function i've implemented allows users to transfer tokens directly from their own addresses to other addresses without requiring approval from an allowance. This means users can directly transfer the debt token without needing to approve the transfer beforehand.


## Changes Made:
1. Added ERC20 transfer functionality to the Variable Debt Token (VDT) contract.
1. Removed revert statements preventing transfers.
1. Ensured consistency with ERC20 standards.


## Security Considerations:

I did not enable the fuctions below;

 ```
 function increaseAllowance(address, uint256) external virtual override returns (bool) {
    revert(Errors.OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED);
  }

  function decreaseAllowance(address, uint256) external virtual override returns (bool) {
    revert(Errors.OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED);
  }
```

Allowing users to alter their allowance can improve the usability of your token. It allows customers to handle their allocations more freely, which can be useful for a variety of purposes.

Security: Allowing users to alter allowances may enhance your contract's attack surface. Malicious actors may leverage allowance management weaknesses to make illicit transactions or drain users' funds.

Allowing users to increase or decrease permissions increases the likelihood of user error. If a user accidentally authorizes a big authorization to a bad contract, it may have unforeseen repercussions.

Gas prices: Implementing these functions may result in higher gas prices for users engaging with your contract. Each allowance modification procedure would result in additional gas fees.

The totalSupply function itself does not directly affect debt positions, enabling token transferability may have broader implications for users and the Aave protocol, which should be carefully considered and managed.
 ```
function totalSupply() public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
    return super.totalSupply().rayMul(POOL.getReserveNormalizedVariableDebt(_underlyingAsset));
  }
```

* Ensure proper testing of the contract before deploying to production.
* Implement role-based access control to restrict sensitive functions.
* Use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy and integer overflow/underflow.
* Regularly audit the contract code for potential security issues.
